# Git & Open Source
12 October 2019

Facebook Developers Circle Lahore invited me to give a talk at there event.
This started with a theoretical talk on how to use Git Version Control System for personal and team projects. Followed by a hands on practice on how to use GitHub to contribute to a GitHub project. 
I also mentioned the significance of Google Summer of Code for Students to help build better careers.
