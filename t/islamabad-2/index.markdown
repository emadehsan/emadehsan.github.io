# Firebase for Student Projects
18 October 2019

At Developer Student Club Summit Pakistan, I was invited to give a technical talk to the DSC leads from Pakistan on how to use Firebase to develop real world projects without worrying about the back-end development. The talk included two demos, one with real time database and one with storage example.

It was a great experience for me as well to meet passionate selected individuals from all over Pakistan. I had the opportunity to meet Googlers from Philippines, Sri Lanka, Vietnam and a few others from SEA region.
