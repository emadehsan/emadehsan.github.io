# Building a Food Classifier with Cloud Vision API 
14 December 2019

The talk was about how for most mobile & web applications, developers don't have to learn ML/DL, train and deploy their own Deep Learning models. Because Google Cloud Vision API makes it super easy to integrate Cloud Vision API and which are production ready and on average reduce the time to market by 50%.

This was full (40 min) presentation that included the explanation of code followed by interactive demo.

I loved the audience, it was a mix of industry and students. They asked some really interesting questions :) . Got to interact with many GDG members and a Googler.
