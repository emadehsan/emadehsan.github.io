# Mobile Sites Certification - mSite
1 July 2019

The workshop was about Google Mobile Sites Certification. I presented the lecture slides to students at Lahore College for Women University. The lecture was a very interactive session where they asked questions on the go. Then gave them time to prepare for the assessment using the course material available on certification's website. 

Students where from non-tech backgrounds. The workshop was organized by E-Rozgaar, a Punjab Govt. initiative and Saad Hamid (Googler). I carried out the workshop and in the end the students took the assessment. 40%+ students cleared the exam in first attempt (keeping in mind they are all from non-tech backgrounds).
The session overall was a 4.5 hours activity.
