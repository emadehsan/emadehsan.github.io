# Anthos - The future of Cloud 
15 June 2019

This was a talk about Anthos by Google Cloud and how it can change the way Cloud is used. Preparing this talk was a great learning experience for myself. Properly understanding the workings of Kubernetes was an important prerequisite.

The audience however, was mostly unaware of Kubernetes. I used a simple case study and architecture diagrams to help students and participants understand how applications are deployed on Kubernetes. After establishing the base, I showed them how these Kubernetes apps can be moved to and between the clouds using Anthos.
