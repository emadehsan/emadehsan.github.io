Emad Ehsan, Personal Website

## Introduction
I built my personal website using the awesome library [Web Slides](https://webslides.tv/). 
It is an open source software and [you can check there code at there GitHub](https://github.com/webslides/webslides/).
If you like this site, you can fork it and convert to your own. Or you can start your own from ground up using Web Slides.

Best
